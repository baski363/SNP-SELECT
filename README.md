SNP variable selection tool

This software is developed to select significan SNP variables without phenotype data.

This program is implemented for numeric genotype data that is coded as 0, 1, and 2. 

Users can adjust the paramaters, including input file (INPUT), threshold value (THRE) and k value (K), based on their need.

Input and output pathway need to be adjusted as well.

To successfully run this C++ program, it requires Gurobi Optimizer being installed. Please refer to http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/ for the details about installing Gurobi Optimizer.
